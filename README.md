#WSO2 Developer Studio Plugins for Carbon Platform

WSO2 Developer Studio has moved in to a kernel-based model with its new architecture revamp from version 4.0.0. WSO2 Developer Studio Platform acts as a middle layer from Devleoper Studio Kernel to Developer Studio product Tooling by bridging the gap for carbon specific requirement implementation on top of Eclipse.

WSO2 Developer Studio Platform has following key capabilities 

- Provide Maven utilities to add maven support for developed plugins 
- Built in support for CApp and Carbon servers 
- Seamless integration with Eclipse, Developer Studio kernel and other plugin features using extension points 
- Connectivity to Carbon Servers and WSO2 cloud

Developer Studio Platform will provide comprehensive support for developing tools and speedup the development process by providing generic Carbon based implementations and requirements.
